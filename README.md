# Next-word-prediction-model

Most of the keyboards in smartphones give next word prediction features; 
Google also uses next word prediction based on our browsing history. 
So a preloaded data is also stored in the keyboard function of our smartphones to predict the next word correctly. 
In this article, I will train a Deep Learning model for next word prediction using Python. 
I will use the Tensorflow and Keras library in Python for next word prediction model.

For making a Next Word Prediction model, I will train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

To run this project, create virtual enviroment and install requirements.txt by using below command .

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then open this project in notebook and run the codes to see the next predicted word.
